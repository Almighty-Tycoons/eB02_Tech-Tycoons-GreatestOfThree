<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

The lab is created to introduce students to the basic knowledge of programming fundamentals of the C
language and to impart writing skill of C programming to the students and solving problems.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

In this experiment, students will learn how to compare three number, and get the greatest of three number as output. To do this comparison, student will use a simple if-else block, and use simulator to show the working of the "if-else ladder".
The program will prompt the user to enter three number and based on the input, it will display the greatest of three number.

<h5> Target Audience : </h5>

Students and faculties / B.tech 1st year students.
