<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

In this laboratory, the students will learn to enforce theoretical concepts of C programming language for finding a solution to a problem. Specifically, for the problem to find greatest of three number.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

In this experiment, students will learn how to compare three number, and get the greatest of three number as output. To do this comparison, student will use a simple if-else block, and simulator will show the working of the "if-else ladder".
The simulator will prompt the user to input three numbers, during execution it intracts with the user and finally it will display the greatest of three numbers.

<h5> Target Audience : </h5>

Students and faculties / B.tech 1st year students.

<h5> Course Alignment : </h5>
