#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concept



#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Define how to declare variables <br> | Remember | Define
2.| User will be able to: <br> Apply relational operators and conditional operator | Apply | Apply
3.| User will be able to: <br> Identify greatest of three numbers <br> | Apply | Identify

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b> 
    
 During the experiment, student knows which value is greatest among three numbers before excution of the program. After execution of the program user expects some predefined result. Therefore it is a case of expository instructional strategy.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Students will be able to <br> Declare variables  | Student will declare data type of the variables| Q1. What are the data types of variable can be used in the code of finding the greatest of three numbers.?<br> <b> A. int </b><br> B. float </b><br> C. char </b><br>D. int or float</b><br> 
2.| Students will be able to<br> Apply relational operators and conditional operators| Student will perform <br> <ul> <li> comparing num1 with num2 and num3.</li><li> comparing num2 with num1 and num3.</li> <li> comparing num3 with num1 and num2.</li> | Q1.  What operator can be used at the place of if-else ladder?<br>A.realtional operator <br> B. bitwise operator <br> <b>C. Ternary operator </b><br>D. logical operator<br>Q2. Which of the following is the correct relational operator?<br> A. +, -, *, %, /  <br> <b> B. >, >=, <, <=, ==, != </b><br>C. := <br>D. ++, -- <br>
3.| Students will be able to<br> Compare three number | Student will apply the comparison | Q3. Find the correct way of comparing three variable.<br> A. if(num1 > num2 > num3){}; <br> <b> B. if((num1>num2) && (num1>num3)){}; </b>

#### 5. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.|<ul><li> Student inputs three numbers in the textbox</li> <li> Student will click <b> OK </b> button.</li> | Simulator will fetch information and store in the variable box  | The purpose is to find greatest of three which simulator have to compare.
2.|<ul><li>Student will click on the <b> Next </b> button </li><li> Student will repeat step 2 until the program has been terminated. </li>|Simulator will show stepwise how compiler performs task line by line <br>  | The purpose is to explore student's mind how compiler works against a Programming language and visualize the theory of working of compiler so the student will learn easily.
