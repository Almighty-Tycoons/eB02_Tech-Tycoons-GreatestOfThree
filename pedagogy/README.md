#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method:Formative assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b> Simulator will show code of find greatest of three numbers. </u>
<br>
 Simulator will take input from user and then it will show the whole code to the user, when the user clicks on next button the code will run one by one and at the same time the output box will show how these codes actually works.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Students will be able to <br> assign values to  variables | Student can perform this using operator | Q1.  what operator can be used at the place of if-else ladder?<br> <b> A.realtional operator </b><br> B. bitwise operator </b><br> c. ternary </b>D. logical operator</b><br> 
2.| Students will be able to<br> find greatest of three numbers| Student will perform <br> <ul> <li> comparing num1 with num2 and num3.</li><li> comparing num2 with num1 and num3.</li> <li> comparing num3 with num1 and num2.</li> | Q2. Which of the following is the correct operator to compare two variables?<br> A.=   <br> <b> B.== </b>C.:=<br>D.equal</b>
3.| <ul> <li> User will be able to apply knowledge of find greatest of three numbers </li><li> In analyzing further problems </li></ul> | Student will assign values to variables | Q1. The problems where find greatest of three numbers can be applied. <br> A. Searching based <br> <b> B. Sorting based </b>

#### 5. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.|<ul><li> Student inputs three numbers in the textbox</li> <li> Student will click <b> OK </b> button.</li> | Simulator will fetch information and store in the variable box  | The purpose is to find greatest of three which simulator have to compare.
2.|<ul><li>Student will click on the <b> Next </b> button </li><li> Student will repeat step 2 until the program has been terminated. </li>|Simulator will show stepwise how compiler performs task line by line <br>  | The purpose is to explore student's mind how compiler works against a Programming language and visualize the theory of working of compiler so the student will learn easily.
